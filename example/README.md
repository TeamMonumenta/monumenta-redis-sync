# Example Plugin

This is an example of a plugin that depends on Monumenta Redis Sync. This example showcases loading shared plugin data when the player logs in, that can then be manipulated. That data is then saved every few minutes or when the player logs out.

This will work on either bungeecord or a Paper server.
