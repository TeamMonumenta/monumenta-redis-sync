 * This event fires when a player joins and their data is loaded but before they are loaded into a world.
 * <p>
 * This is useful to change the player's world seamlessly without them ever seeing a flash of a different world on join.
 * <p>
 * Note that at the time this event is called, the player's scores are available but all player data is blank, including inventory and tags.
 * The API MonumentaRedisSyncAPI.getPlayerWorldData() is also available at this point
